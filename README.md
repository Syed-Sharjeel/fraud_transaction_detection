A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent transactions using Logistic Regression. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations to analyze fraud patterns. The dataset consists of financial transactions with various risk factors.

# Key Features:
 - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
 - Feature Engineering (One-hot encoding, scaling numerical features)
 - Model Training & Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
 - Fraud Detection Insights (Visualizing fraud patterns across different locations)

# Technologies Used: 
Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
