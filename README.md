## Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**  
This project implements a **fraud transaction detection system** using **Logistic Regression**. It analyzes transactional data to identify fraudulent activities based on key financial and behavioral indicators. The model is deployed as a **web-based interactive application** for real-time fraud prediction.  

## Features: 
- Machine Learning-based fraud detection  
- Streamlit-powered web interface  
- Real-time transaction analysis  
- Scalable and efficient model  

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Logistic Regression, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
- Streamlit (for interactive web application)  

## Dataset:
- Synthetic Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)
- 50,000 transactions with 19 features
